# TransCoPhy: Modernizing Causal Physical Reasoning with Transformers

This repository contains the modified codebase from the paper ["CoPhy: Counterfactual Learning of Physical Dynamics", F. Baradel, N. Neverova, J. Mille, G. Mori, C. Wolf, ICLR'2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12000). 

This project involves replacing the outdated RNN architecture with a transformer encoder for the latent confounders encoding step. The main modifications are in `cf_learning/model.py` and `cf_learning/main.py`.
